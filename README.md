### Hi there 👋

<img align="left" src="me.jpg" alt="image not found" width="150" style="border: 20px solid  black;">

<div>
My journey into technology began with a deep curiosity about how complex systems function—both biological and technological. Earning degrees in Computer Science and Physiology from Southern Illinois University Carbondale shaped the way I approach problem-solving: analytically, systematically, and with a focus on optimization. I’ve always been driven to understand intricate systems and make them work more efficiently.

Today, in my role at Ferrilli Consulting, I bring that systems-oriented mindset to institutions across higher education. I specialize in Ellucian’s Colleague ERP, helping colleges and universities streamline processes, modernize reporting, and build scalable, sustainable technical solutions. From migrating legacy state reports to PostgreSQL for SaaS compatibility to developing integrations and refining workflows, I focus on transforming complex challenges into practical, forward-thinking solutions.

At Ferrilli, I collaborate with diverse institutional teams, providing strategic guidance and hands-on technical expertise to ensure enterprise systems truly support student success and operational excellence. Whether optimizing ERP environments, enhancing reporting infrastructures, or solving mission-critical issues, my goal remains the same: simplify complexity and empower institutions through thoughtful, effective technology solutions.

As higher education continues to evolve, I’m energized by the opportunity to help institutions adapt, innovate, and maximize the value of their technology investments.</div>
